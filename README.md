# cablan_path_segment_fix
In June 2012, I discovered that the very common TYPO3 extension "Real URL" didn't properly store the path of pages in certain non-latin languages, even if TYPO3 already worked with them. I thus wrote a small extension to fix the missing paths which prevented the Japanese site of a client from being browsed. After testing, other languages were found to need the fix.
